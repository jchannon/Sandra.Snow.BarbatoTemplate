As of beginning of April 2018 Botwin has been renamed to Carter.  Whilst I thought the name was genius it became obvious that some people didn't like it or understand it and tried to interpret it as a Bot framework for Windows.  After spending too long trying to think of a new name I finally decided upon Carter. Carter comes from the surname of Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) and in his song Empire State of Mind he sings "I'm the new Sinatra". Sinatra is a web framework which inspired Nancy which heavily inspired Botwin.

The last release of Botwin was 3.5.0 but the same package has also been released under Carter 3.5.0

As part of the rename I have created a Github organization with the Carter repository inside it - [https://github.com/CarterCommunity](https://github.com/CarterCommunity).  If people would like to build their own Carter extensions then they can push to repositories in that organization and maintain the repos from there.  A little attempt to build an OSS community for Carter.  Let me know if you'd like to add a repo.

Also we now have a Carter Slack channel.  Please sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/t/cartercommunity/shared_invite/enQtMzQwNjIwODcwMTMxLWQwMjk5NDFlYWI3Yzg5Y2M4ODNmOTkwMzA2YjkxNmE0YjI3YWU4MjU2ZjI2NmQwMmE4NjVlODBlM2RlMDI1ZmY) and if you have any questions or just want to check Carter out please jump in!

You'll also notice Carter has a new logo, indicating you can parachute Carter into your application and all will be well!!
